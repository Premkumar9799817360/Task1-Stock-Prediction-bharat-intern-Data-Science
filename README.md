# üìà STOCK PREDICTION (Bharat Intern)

## üß† Project Overview
This project ‚Äî **Task 1: Stock Prediction (Bharat Intern - Data Science)** ‚Äî focuses on predicting the **future stock prices** of a chosen company using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model.  
LSTM networks are highly effective for **time series forecasting** as they can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Understanding & Preprocessing
- Loaded the stock price dataset of the selected company.  
- Performed **data exploration and correlation analysis** to understand patterns and trends.  
- Applied **feature engineering** and normalization using `MinMaxScaler` to scale data between 0 and 1 for stable LSTM training.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Time Series Split
Used **TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=10)** for model validation.  
This ensures that the model is trained and tested on data in **chronological order**, preserving the **time dependency** of stock prices.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building ‚Äì LSTM
- Built a **Sequential LSTM Model** using Keras.  
- Added **Dense layers** for output prediction.  
- Used **Adam Optimizer** to minimize loss and improve model performance.  
- Trained the model on scaled time series data to predict future stock closing prices.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Comparison
Along with LSTM, implemented a **Decision Tree Regressor** to compare model performance.  
- The **Decision Tree** provided a baseline for prediction accuracy.  
- The **LSTM** model was finalized as the main predictive model due to its superior performance on sequential data.
